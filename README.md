# 🫀 Heart Risk Prediction & AI Health Assistant

This is a web-based application designed to provide an estimated risk level for heart conditions based on key health metrics. It also features an integrated AI chatbot, "Cardio-Bot," powered by the Google Gemini API, to answer general questions about heart health and lifestyle choices.

The application uses a secure backend proxy to protect the API key, ensuring that it is never exposed to the client-side browser.
